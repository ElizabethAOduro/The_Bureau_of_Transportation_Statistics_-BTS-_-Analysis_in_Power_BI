## WHY POWER BI?
 Power BI offers powerful data visualization, interactive dashboards, and seamless data integration from multiple sources. Its user-friendly interface, advanced analytics, automation, and real-time reporting make it ideal for uncovering freight movement patterns, identifying inefficiencies, and generating actionable insights for better decision-making in transborder freight analysis.

 ## USING THE CRISP-DM METHODOLOGY---
 CRISP-DM ensures a structured, repeatable approach to data analysis. It helps analysts extract meaningful insights while aligning findings with business needs.
 ## THE STEPS FOLLOWED INCLUDE:
 
## 1. Business Understanding
The objective of this analysis is to gain insights into transborder freight transportation between Canada and Mexico. The study identifies trends in freight charges, trade types, and modes of transport to provide recommendations for optimizing logistics and cost efficiency.

## 2. Data Understanding
The dataset was a contains records of freight transactions categorized by country, trade type, transport mode, and freight charges.
It is made up of 
## 14 columns and 4,179,119 rows

## Key attributes include:
Country Code (Canada, Mexico)
Year and Month
Trade Type (Import, Export)
Transport Mode (Truck, Rail, Air, Vessel, Pipeline)
Freight Charges
Ship Weight


3. Data Preparation
Data cleaning: Removed null values and standardized column names.
Data transformation: Aggregated values by year, mode of transport, and trade type.
Feature engineering: Created additional calculated fields for better visualization.

4. Modeling

Built interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize:

Freight charges by transport mode

Yearly trends in trade volume and charges

Import vs. Export trade distribution

Country-wise freight charge comparisons

5. Evaluation

The model accurately represents trends and patterns in transborder freight transport.

Insights extracted include:

Truck transport dominates the trade, contributing to congestion and higher costs.

Rail and air freight have significantly higher charges but lower volumes.

Canada has higher freight charges than Mexico.

6. Deployment

The Power BI dashboard is the final deliverable, designed for decision-makers to analyze freight data efficiently.

Recommendations include:

Improving rail infrastructure to reduce costs.

Enhancing road transport tracking systems for better efficiency.

This analysis serves as a foundation for improving transborder trade logistics and optimizing transportation costs.
